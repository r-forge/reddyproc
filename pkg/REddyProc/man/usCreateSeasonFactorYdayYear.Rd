\description{calculate factors to denote the season for uStar-Filtering by specifying starting day and year of each season}
\usage{usCreateSeasonFactorYdayYear(dates, yday = as.POSIXlt(dates)$yday + 
    1L, year = as.POSIXlt(dates)$year + 1900L, starts)}
\arguments{
  \item{dates}{POSIXct vector of length of the data set to be filled, specifying the center-time of each record}
  \item{yday}{integer (1-366) vector of length of the data set to be filled, specifying the day of the year (1..366) for each record}
  \item{year}{integer vector of length of the data set to be filled, specifying the year}
  \item{starts}{data.frame with first column specifying the starting yday (integer 1-366) and second column the year (integer e.g. 1998) for each season in increasing order}
}
\details{With default parameterization, dates are assumed to denote begin or center of the eddy time period.
If working with dates that denote the end of the period, use \code{yday=as.POSIXlt(fGetBeginOfEddyPeriod(dates))$yday}
}
\value{Integer vector of nrow ds, each unique class representing one season}
