\description{Default list of parameters for determining UStar of a single binned series	}
\usage{usControlUstarEst(ustPlateauFwd = 10, ustPlateauBack = 6, 
    plateauCrit = 0.95, corrCheck = 0.5, firstUStarMeanCheck = 0.2, 
    isOmitNoThresholdBins = TRUE, isUsingCPTSeveralT = FALSE, 
    isUsingCPT = FALSE, minValidUStarTempClassesProp = 0.2, 
    minValidBootProp = 0.4, minNuStarPlateau = 3L)}
\arguments{
  \item{ustPlateauFwd}{number of subsequent uStar bin values to compare to in fwd mode}
  \item{ustPlateauBack}{number of subsequent uStar bin values to compare to in back mode}
  \item{plateauCrit}{significant differences between a u* value and the mean of a "plateau"}
  \item{corrCheck}{threshold value for correlation between Tair and u* data}
  \item{firstUStarMeanCheck}{if first uStar bin average of a class is already larger than this value, the temperature class is skipped.}
  \item{isOmitNoThresholdBins}{if TRUE, bins where no threshold was found are ignored. Set to FALSE to report highest uStar bin for these cases}
  \item{isUsingCPTSeveralT}{set to TRUE to use changePointDetection without binning uStar but with additionally changed aggregation scheme for several temperature classifications}
  \item{isUsingCPT}{set to TRUE to use changePointDetection without binning uStar before in usual aggregation method (good for comparing methods, but not recommended, overruled by isUsingCPTSeveralT=TRUE)}
  \item{minValidUStarTempClassesProp}{seasons, in which only less than this proportion of temperature classes a threshold was detected, are excluded from aggregation}
  \item{minValidBootProp}{minimum proportion of bootstrap samples for which a threshold was detected. Below this proportion NA quantiles are reported.}
  \item{minNuStarPlateau}{minimum number of records in plateau, threshold must be larger than mean of this many bins}
