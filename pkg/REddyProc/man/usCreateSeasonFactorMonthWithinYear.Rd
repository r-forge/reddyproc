\description{calculate factors to denote the season for uStar-Filtering by specifying starting months, with seasons not spanning year boundaries}
\usage{usCreateSeasonFactorMonthWithinYear(dates, month = as.POSIXlt(dates)$mon + 
    1, year = as.POSIXlt(dates)$year + 1900, startMonth = c(3, 
    6, 9, 12))}
\arguments{
  \item{dates}{POSIXct vector of length of the data set to be filled, specifying the center-time of each record}
  \item{month}{integer (1-12) vector of length of the data set to be filled, specifying the month for each record}
  \item{year}{integer vector of length of the data set to be filled, specifying the year}
  \item{startMonth}{integer vector specifying the starting month for each season, counting from one
default is (Dez,Jan,Feb)(Mar,April,May)(June,July,August),(Sept,Okt,Nov)}
}
\details{If Jan is not a starting month, then the first months of each year will be

E.g. with the default the fourth period of the first year consists of Jan,Feb,Dec.}
\value{Integer vector length(dates), with each unique value representing one season}
